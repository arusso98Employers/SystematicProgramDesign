The fight between your base and the invader is a bit one-sided at this point. Itâ€™s far more sporting to let the invader shoot back.

Extend your program such that the invader shoots down toward the base.

The invader shoots at a regular interval every N ticks of the clock. (Note: if N is small, several shots may be present on the screen at once.)

Each shot that hits the base costs 1 life.

The base starts with 3 lives.

The game ends when the base has no lives yet.
