# SystematicProgramDesign
CMSC 131A is an introduction to computing and programming. Its major goal is to introduce students to the principles of systematic problem solving through programming and the basic rules of computation.Program design is the study of systematic thought, planning, and universally useful problem-solving skills applied in the setting of programming and computation. By the end of the course, majors in computer science will have a sense for difference between a programmer and a well-trained software developer. Students from all majors will have a sense of the complexities involved in developing solid software (highly useful in case they ever collaborate with such professionals) and they ought to be able to use the principles of programming to solve many non-computational problems in a systematic manner.
