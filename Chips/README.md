Design a variant of the Chip program that has two sheep that start off on opposite sides of the screen and run toward eachother. When their heads butt, they should “bounce” off running the other direction. The left sheep (notice that the sheep can never pass each other) should be controlled with the "a" and "d" keys for changing direction toward the left and right, respectively. The right sheep is controlled with the left and right arrow keys as before.
